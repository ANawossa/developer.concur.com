Spend User Provisioning allows callers to provision a user in the SAP Concur Spend domain. This is an asynchronous downstream process from the [User Provisioning v4](/api-reference/user-provisioning/v4.user-provisioning.html) service. Currently Spend user data can be created, modified, and replaced with the POST, PATCH and PUT provisioning operations. The retrieval of Spend user data is supported through GET endpoints: One that can retrieve a filtered and paginated set of all Spend users in a company, and another that can retrieve a specific Spend user's data using their unique identifier.

> **Limitations**: This API is only available to partners who have been granted access by SAP Concur. Access to this documentation does not provide access to the API.
